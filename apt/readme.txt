### Windows Insane Level
This Windows insane-difficulty machine was quite challenging, but mostly due to its use
of some unconventional settings. Breaking in involved many of the normal enumeration and 
privilege escalation techniques that are used against Windows machines, but some tweaks 
by the administrator made it more challenging to find out how to even begin. This machine 
gave me a chance to learn a lot about using some of the standard Impacket tools in new ways, 
such as using Kerberos tickets along with IPv6. I hope you enjoy this challenge as much as I did!
