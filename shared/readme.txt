# HTB Shared
### Linux Medium
### Synopsis:
Shared is a medium-rated Linux machine from Hack The Box. Compared to the last few boxes I’ve done, this was a real smooth ride as we’re basically jumping from exploit to exploit. The path for each step is clear and there are plenty of hints along the way. Looking back the box have sharpened my knowledge in some areas, while also introducing tools I’ve never seen or used before. For me this medium box is on the easier side of medium and didn’t take many hours at all to complete. It was a fun experience and I’d recommend the box to you!
