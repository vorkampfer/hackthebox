# HTB Hawk
# Linux
# Difficulty: Medium
### Synopsis:
Hawk was a very fun box. It covered openssl, ssh tunneling, SQL H2 Database Exploitation, and a couple other things that I never knew before. Oh yeah, the bash script I uploaded did not work for me. I wound up using the openssl-bruteforce script from github.

### Skill-set:
1. OpenSSL Cipher Brute Force and Decryption
2. Drupal Enumeration/Exploitation
3. H2 Database Exploitation
