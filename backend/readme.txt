# HTB Backend
# Linux
# Difficulty: Medium

### Synopsis:
Backend was all about enumerating and abusing an API, first to get access to the Swagger docs, then to get admin access, and then debug access. From there it allows execution of commands, which provides a shell on the box. To escalate to root, Iâ€™ll find a root password in the application logs where the user must have put in their password to the name field. ~0xdf
