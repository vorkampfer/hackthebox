# HTB Precious 
### Linux Easy
### Objectives:
```Ruby
Precious is an Easy Linux box on HackTheBox, released on November 26, 2022. 
Its high rating and easy difficulty make it an attactive way to get back into 
HTB after a short hiatus. It prominently features the Ruby language, and usage 
of ruby gems - hence the name. While the foothold is fairly straightforward, 
the path to root takes a bit of thought!
