# HTB Validation
# Linux
### Difficulty: Easy
### Synopsis:
Validation is another box HTB box made for the UHC competition. It is a qualifier box, 
meant to be easy and help select the top ten to compete later this month. Once it was 
done on UHC, HTB makes it available. We start out with some basic SQL injection querries. 
Then we automate this with 2 python scripts. The first one is a minimal script that requires 
a listener to be setup first. The second one is compeletly automated. Just follow the usage 
instructions. The privesc is super simple. All in all a very fun box, and a great code-along imo.

### Skill-set:
1. SQLI (Error Based)
2. SQLI -> RCE (INTO OUTFILE)
3. Information Leakage
