# BlackArch Rules! I only hack with BlackArch. So if you like that platform then you should check out my writeups on HacktheBox.
1. 95 percent of these walkthroughs I did using the BlackArch platform. In a very few I used Parrot, or Kali.
2.  I am making this repo of hackthebox write-ups of retired VIP machines in PDF. You will need a VIP account at HacktheBox for most of these machines.
3. I plan on uploading at least 100 write-ups to help newcommers of the cyber security community that are trying to learn cyber security from zero like I did. That is why I created my walk-throughs as supplementals to the already amazing content by some of the best in Hacking i.e. ippsec (YouTube), 0xdf (Gitlab), S4vitar (YouTube), and many more. Check out these channels for great content, and if you are missing something perhaps I have it covered in my supplemental write-ups.
4. I had planned on uploading .md format as well, but I realize that is a-lot of uploading so that is changed. I may do it in the future.
