# HTB Brainfuck
## Linux Insane

### Synopsis:
Brainfuck was one of the first boxes released on HackTheBox. It’s a much more unrealistic and CTF style box than would appear on HTB today, 
but there are still elements of it that can be a good learning opportunity. There’s WordPress exploitation and a bunch of crypto, including 
RSA and Vigenere. ~0xdf
